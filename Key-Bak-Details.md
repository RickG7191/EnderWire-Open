# Key-Bak Details
The adjustable tension Key-Bak dispenses with the Key-Bak housing and only uses the cord and flat coil spring. As illustrated in the images below, the spring housing meshes with the cord spool in such a way that allows the spring to be wound tighter or looser in order to match the gantry load. In addition to the original intent of the Key-Bak to prevent the grantry from unexpectedly dropping if the XY-motors loose power, it also counterbalances the gantry weight to minimize the differential motor load between upward and downward gantry movements. Note that this sort of adjustment can be accomplished with the unmodified Key-Bak by adjusting the length of the cord. Otherwise, I just wanted the Key-Bak mechanism tucked away under the deck with an easy way to adjust the tension. Personal preference.
